# Arduino_Morse_Code_Translator
An Arduino program that takes light pulses from a fiber optic transmitter and converts them into a form of Morse Code to be displayed on the serial monitor.

The light source was a white LED powered by a 9V battery which was placed in a black box along with a resistor with a push button to trigger the light and fiber optic cable connecting to one end. The other end of the cable was connected to a photoresistor also surrounded by a black sheath to prevent ambient light from seeping in. This was connected to the Arduino running the program via a breadboard and jumper wires.
